 * The names of the SDK's built-in tools, as data.

 * Kept out of `options.server.ts` so they can be read without pulling in `$env` and the
 * rest of the server surface. Three layers have to agree with these names: the
 * containment guard in `./workspace-guard`, which knows how each one names its path
 * argument; the read-only agent allow-list in `$lib/agents/builtin-agents.server`; and
 * the option builder itself. A test that checks those agree has to be able to import
 * them, and importing the server module from the Playwright runtime fails on `$env`.
