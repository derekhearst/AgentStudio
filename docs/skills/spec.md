# Skills Spec

## Overview

A skill is a reusable markdown bundle that teaches an agent how to use a tool, execute a workflow, or apply domain knowledge — without bloating the base system prompt. Skills are the progressive disclosure mechanism for instructions. They load on demand, not on every turn. The skills domain manages creation, retrieval, versioning, and runtime loading of all skill content.

## Data Model

### `skill_files` table (optional companion files)

Some skills have associated files (code snippets, templates, reference docs).

| Column      | Type      | Description    |
| ----------- | --------- | -------------- |
| `id`        | uuid      | Primary key    |

| `name`      | text      | Filename       |
| `content`   | text      | File content   |
| `createdAt` | timestamp |                |

| `system/mode-plan`             | Plan mode — Karpathy four principles, proposes before executing  | DB-seeded on first boot |
| `system/mode-agent`            | Agent mode — autonomous executor, interrupts only for blockers   | DB-seeded on first boot |
| `agent/<slug>/identity`        | Per-agent identity content                                       | User-created            |

#### Hook skills

Skill-backed hook implementations. Named `hook/<event-name>`.

| Slug                    | Covers                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `hook/after-run-notify` | Custom notification logic for run completion |
| `hook/memory-capture`   | Memory mining trigger on run completion      |

### Summary vs. full body loading

Every skill has a `summary` field and a `content` field. The runtime loads them differently:

| What                      | When                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `summary` (1–2 sentences) | Automatically, for all companion skills listed in `config.companionSkills` |
| Full `content`            | On demand, when the model calls `read_skill(slug)` or a hook forces it     |

The model calls `read_skill` when it needs the full operating guide. This keeps initial context lean.

### `read_skill` tool

Available whenever the `skills` capability group is enabled:

```
read_skill(slug: string) → Returns the full content of the skill
list_skills(category?: string) → Returns all active skills with their summaries
```

### Skill editor UI

`/skills` — paginated list of all skills grouped by category, with search.
`/skills/[slug]` — full-page markdown editor for the skill content and summary. Saving increments `version` and takes effect on the next skill load.
`/skills/new` — create a skill with a slug, category, summary, and body.

### Skill seeding strategy

System skills are seeded in two distinct ways depending on their purpose:

**In-code constants (read-only system docs)**

Skills like `drokbot-guide` are hardcoded as TypeScript constants with fixed UUIDs. They are synthesized at read time — they never write to the DB. All edit/delete operations are blocked by `isSystemSkill()` guards. Use this pattern for content that should never be accidentally deleted or corrupted: quickstart guides, feature maps, onboarding docs.

**DB-seeded on first boot (editable identity skills)**

Mode identity skills (`system/mode-*`) and the orchestrator identity (`system/orchestrator-identity`) are inserted into the DB on first boot using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. This means:

- The default content is written once and then the DB record is the source of truth
- The user (or an agent) can edit the content through the Skills UI without a redeploy
- If reset is needed, delete the skill row — the next boot re-seeds the default
- Changes take effect on the next turn, not the next deploy

This is the correct pattern for any skill that is meant to be tunable — particularly behavioral identity prompts.

### Repo file boot loader

On startup, AgentStudio scans for `SKILL.md` files in the repo (configurable scan paths, e.g., `docs/**`). Each file's YAML frontmatter declares the slug and category; the body becomes the content. Existing DB records are upserted if the file's slug matches.

```yaml
---
slug: tools/fs-editing
category: tool
title: Filesystem Editing
summary: Teaches the agent when to use file_patch vs. file_replace and how to verify edits succeeded.
---
```

Priority: controlled by `SKILL_SOURCE_PRIORITY=repo|db` (default: `db`).

### Companion skill requirement for new capability groups

When a new capability group is added to the system, a companion tool skill for that group is required before the group is considered "complete." This is enforced by convention and checked in CI.

### Hook-backed skills

Skill slugs starting with `hook/` are treated as hook implementations. When a hook fires for the matching event, the skill body is submitted as a prompt to a lightweight subagent that executes it and returns output to `hook_invocations`.

## Behavior Contracts

- `skills.slug` is unique and immutable after creation. Renaming a slug creates a new skill; the old slug remains available.
- Editing a skill body increments `version` and takes effect on the next runtime load; it does not affect in-progress runs.
- A skill with `isActive = false` is not returned by `list_skills` and is not loaded by the runtime.
- Identity skills cannot be deleted while linked to an active agent; they must be unlinked first.
- `summary` is required and must be ≤200 characters. This is enforced on save.
- Skills are not versioned with immutable history (unlike artifact versions). The `version` counter tracks how many times the skill was edited; old content is not retained.
